# Core Events

## Introduction

Core Events are pre-defined Platform Events that are provided by the Scale8 Platform. This is similar to the list of events provided by Google Tag Manager, Telium, Adobe DTM etc.

<Info>

A new feature will be released soon, that will make other Platforms created by developers outside Scale8 available. These new Platforms can contain Platform Events and users will be free to install and use them.
