# Deleting your Account

## Permanently delete your Account

<Warn>

If you choose to delete your account this is permanent. You will always be welcome to rejoin again at another point in time, but we are unable to restore your access. We will purge all your personal details and also unlink your account from any Organizations for which you are currently member.

</Warn>

You will be unable to delete your account if you are an owner of an Organization. You will first need to transfer ownership of that Organization or delete the Organization in question in order to proceed.

To access the menu, please follow the [instructions found here](/docs/manage-your-account#displaying-the-menu).
