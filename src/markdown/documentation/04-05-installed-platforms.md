# Installed Platforms

## Introduction

At the moment, the Scale8 Platform is automatically installed on all new Applications. The Installed Platforms page will provide a way for website owners to manage all their connected platforms in one place. Developers will be able to create and release new and versioned platforms that can be installed and managed by website owners. We have some big plans for this feature and will be coming later this year.
