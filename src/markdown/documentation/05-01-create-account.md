# Create an Account

To use our Data Manager service you'll first need to create an account. If this is your first time using our Data Manager service then you should be eligible for our 30-day free trial.

If you don't currently have an account please [sign-up](/sign-up/data-manager) for an account. We only ask for the minimum amount of information required to create your account, and we'll never sell your personal information to third parties.

The email link should return you back and from there we'll prepare your new account and log you in automatically.
