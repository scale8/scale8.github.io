# Global Action Group Distributions

## Introduction

Global Action Group Distributions provide a way to link a single group of Actions to multiple Rules. This can greatly simplify the management of both Tags and Rules, delivering a quick way to propagate changes to all connected Rules, across multiple Tags simultaneously.

To locate Global Action Group Distributions, navigate to your Revision and on the left menu under Tags and Global Triggers there will be a menu item called 'Global Actions'. We have simplified the name here to make it more manageable in the menu.

For the rest of this document we will refer to Global Action Group Distributions as Global Actions.
