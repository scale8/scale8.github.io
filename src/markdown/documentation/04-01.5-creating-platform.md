# Creating a Platform

<Info>

This feature is still currently in beta testing and will be released towards the end of 2021 Q4 / early Q1 2022. If you are interested in learning more, please reach out to us, and we might be able to offer you access to the early beta.

## Introduction

We have abstracted our platform logic in such a way that enables developers to quickly build their own platforms and deliver them via the Scale8 infrastructure.

There are two types of application, the first is a **Templated** version that is similar to Google's Tag Manager and exposes a custom JavaScript sandbox API. This offers many advantages and disadvantages too, so we will also enable developers to publish their own **Custom** JavaScript code too.
