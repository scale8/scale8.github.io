## Getting Started

To start building out on our API all you require is a Scale8 account, required access permissions and knowledge of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).
For more information on making your first API request, please see [API Authentication](APIToken.md)

## Design

We have built out on GraphQL due to the fact it offers a consistent structured query language. It enables us to manage and thoroughly document our product APIs.
If you are unfamiliar with GraphQL it is worth heading over to [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and learning the core concepts before attempting to use our API for the first time.
GraphQL is fully supported in just about every programming language and there is partial list maintained [here](https://graphql.org/code/).

## Our UI

Our entire UI is built on our own API. Everything you do in the UI can be managed from the API. The API allows you to go future and abstract and automate your own tasks or workflows.
If there is something you feel we could be doing better, please let us know, we could either help guide you or add a new feature to our UI.

## Updates

Our platform is rapidly evolving, but we guarantee documentation will stay up to date. We have built this into our release process, however we will notify developers of any breaking changes ahead of time.
We don't expect this to be a regular occurrence, but occasionally we will not be able to offer backwards compatibility. We will deprecate where possible and leave warnings in place for a minimum of 3 months.
