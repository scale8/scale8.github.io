Inspired by platforms like GitHub we have put the user first meaning they can belong to one or more Organizations.\\n\\nYour current team members for an organisation will be available in the 'Users' sections of the selected Organisation.\\n\\n![Users list](/img/organization/users.png)\\n\\n## Create a new team member\\n\\nIn order to invite team members, you'll need to navigate into your Organization and select 'User Invites'. Select the 'Add' icon in the top right of the page.\\nYou should be presented with a ride-side window pane prompting you to enter the email address of the new team member. Tick all the relevant permissions you would like to have and click the 'Invite User' button at the bottom to complete the process.\\nThe new team member should receive an email asking them to join the organization. If they don't currently have a Scale8 account they will be prompted to first sign-up before having the option to join your organization.\\n\\n![Users list](/img/organization/invite.png)\\n\\n<Warn>\\n\\nInvites should deliver almost instantly and certainly within a few minutes. Should the email invite not arrive, please make sure you have request that your new team member has checked all inbox folders, including their spam folder before trying to re-issue another invite.\\n\\n</Warn>\\n\\n## Edit an existing user\\n\\nTo change an existing users permissions, please see [Understanding permissions and ownership](/docs/managing-your-team#understanding-permissions-and-ownership)\\n\\n<Info>\\n\\nTo change your own details, please visit [Manage Your Account](/docs/manage-your-account).\\n\\n</Info>\\n\\n## Deleting an invitation\\n\\nShould an invitation be sent in error, or the invite request is no longer relevant then this can be safely removed. To remove this invitation, please select the 'Trash' icon in the 'User Invites' list against the selected invitation.\\n\\n<Info>\\n\\nOnce deleted this will prevent a new team member signing up with the existing invite. A new invite will need to be created before they are able to join your organization.\\n\\n</Info>\\n\\n## Removing team members\\n\\nOn the users table you also have an action to remove a user. Once the user has been removed they will lose access to your organization. This action will not remove the user account however.\\n\\nThe organization owner cannot be removed, and you cannot remove yourself from the organization in the users section.\\n\\nShould you wish to leave an organization go to \\\"Settings\\\" and select \\\"Leave organization\\\". If you are currently the organization owner you need to transfer the ownership before leaving an organization.\\n\\n## Transferring ownership\\n\\nOwnership of an organisation can be transferred at any time to another user within your team. Once you do this however, you will not be able to manage some settings, billing information or manage invoices.\\n\\nTo transfer ownership, first make sure that you are in-face the owner of the Organization. Nagivate to the Organzation's settings page and scroll down to 'Transfer Ownership' section. If this section is missing then you are not currently registered as the owner and will be unable to transfer ownership.\\n\\n![Transfer Ownership](/img/organization/transfer-ownership.png)\\n\\n## Understanding permissions and ownership\\n\\nYou can alter a team member's permissions using the edit action on the 'Users' section, you cannot edit your own permissions however.\\n\\nEvery organization has an owner who has access to billing and all organization settings. Please see 'Transferring 'ownership' above if you wish to make another team member the owner instead.\\n\\n\"}")}}]);
