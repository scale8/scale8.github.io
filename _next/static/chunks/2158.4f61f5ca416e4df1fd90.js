To make this switch, either navigate to Organization 'Settings' or follow any of the prompts requesting that you 'Upgrade to a paid plan'.\\n\\n![Update Request](/img/organization/upgrade-request.png)\\n\\n## Selecting the right plan\\n\\nAll of our plans are based on usage caps. We honestly don't mind the occasional spike in traffic or a small amount of overage, but if you are consistently going over you plan (more than 2 months in a row) we request that you upgrade to the next plan. All upgrades are pro-rated from the moment you switch, and you will only be charged for what you've already used of the previous plan.\\n\\n### Tag Manager\\n\\nOur Tag Manager is billed on usage plans based on a fixed number of events. This includes all the events you send to the Tag Manager and not just 'Page Views'. You'll need to chose a plan that best fits your usage patterns. We suggest using our in-built analytics to help calculate how many events you need to process and select a plan according to that. If you need to discuss further, we are here to help, so please contact us.\\n\\n### Data Manager\\n\\nThe Data Manager has plans based on data ingested and number of requests you make. When selecting a plan we suggest working out how much data you send and also how many requests are made per month. You'll need to pick that plan that best meets both. If you have been using our free trial with real-world consumption, please take a look at your dashboard to help you decide. If you are stuck or would like to discuss, please reach out to us.\\n\\n## Subscribing to a plan\\n\\nWe have partnered with Stripe to help process our subscriptions. Stripe stores all of your billing information on our behalf and helps us process and manage payments. When you select a plan you will be forward to our Stripe portal to enter your billing information and start your subscription.\\n\\n![Subscripe to a plan](/img/organization/subscribe.png)\\n\\nOnce completed, you'll be sent back to Scale8, and we'll take things from there and make sure your account is set up and configured correctly.\\n\\n## Changing your Billing information\\n\\nAt the bottom of your Organization 'Settings' page, you'll find a button titled 'Manage Payments And Invoices'.\\n\\n![Billing portal link](/img/organization/billing-portal-link.png)\\n\\n<Info>\\n\\nIn this area you'll be able to manage all of your billing information.
