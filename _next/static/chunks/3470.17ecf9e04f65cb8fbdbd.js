This offers many advantages and disadvantages too, so we will also enable developers to publish their own **Custom** JavaScript code too.\\n\\n![Tag Manager - Create Platforms](/img/tag-manager/tag-manager-create-platforms.png)\\n\\n<Info>\\n\\nThis documentation will be updated shortly once all API for this feature has been finalised.\\n\\n</Info>"}')}}]);
