We\'re testing new storage backends all the time, so if we don\'t support yours now, please reach out and will see if we can add it.\\n\\n![Data Manager - Storage Providers](/img/data-manager/data-manager-storage-providers.png)\\n\\nOur simple var-type structure allows us to model your data ready for ingest into any number of formats, and our revisioning system helps you to keep track of all your changes.\\n\\nWe offer macro support, with several new macros in the pipeline. We also offer string, integer and float validation. Strings can be validated using a custom regex and this supports all expressions that can be evaluated in linear time.\\n\\nThis is just the start of things to come too. We\u2019ve been working on some industry leading and innovative solutions that we aim to open-source in the future.\\n\\nPlease take a look at our [getting started guide](/docs/ingest-endpoints#create-an-ingest-endpoint). Feedback is always welcome and if there is something else you believe we should be offering, please reach out to us and let us know."}')}}]);
